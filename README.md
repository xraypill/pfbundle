    ]
}
```

### üõ† Config Explanation  

#### **üîπ `dev`**  
The private key of the **developer wallet** (used for deploying the token). (Dev initially buying only 0.1sol (there should be atleast 0.25 sol)) 

#### **üîπ `buyers`**  
An array containing the **private keys of buyer wallets** that will execute purchases in a bundle.  

#### **üîπ `solValues`**  
The **amount of SOL each wallet will use for the purchase**, in order from top to bottom.  
- It's recommended to **add an extra 0.03 SOL** to each wallet for transaction fees.  
- If a wallet is set to buy **0.5 SOL**, ensure it has at least **0.54 SOL** loaded.  

#### **üîπ `mintKeypairs`**  
The **private key of the token mint wallet**, which is required for managing liquidity and supply.  

---

## üîë Generating `mintKeypairs`   

You need to **generate a new mint keypair** with pump sufix before deploying your token. Use the following command:  

```sh
solana-keygen grind --ends-with pump:1
```

Then, open the private key from file ***pump.json.
Copy the **array of numbers** and paste it inside `"mintKeypairs"` in `config.json`.  

---

## üñº Setting the Token Image

This repository includes a placeholder file image.png. To set your token's image, simply replace image.png with your own .png file (keeping the same filename and format).

Make sure the file is correctly formatted and is a square image for the best display results on Solana platforms (500x500 for example);

---

## üöÄ Running the Bot  

Once everything is configured, start the process:  

```sh
node start.js
```

The bot will:  
‚úÖ Deploy the token  
‚úÖ Execute initial purchases from 15 wallets  
‚úÖ Manage transactions automatically  

---

## üì¢ Notes  

- Ensure all wallets have **enough SOL** for buying and selling, considering transaction fees.  
- Double-check that `config.json` contains valid private keys.  
- This setup **automates deployment**, making it **ideal for PumpFun launches**.
